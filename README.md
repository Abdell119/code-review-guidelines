# Code Review Guidelines
The purpose of this guide is to define standards for all code reviews done by Trainers in Andela and also ensure that code written by Andela fellows are top notch and excellent. These guidelines are to be applied for checkpoint assessments as well as regular day to day code reviews performed in your role as Senior Engineer.

As a Senior Engineer, code review is one of the most important aspects of what you do and doing it right is instrumental to grooming the right type of engineers and writing effective code in general.

Most of the information provided in this document was adopted from the [Thoughtbot Code Review Guide](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/code-review).
