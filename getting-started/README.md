# Before you start reviewing

### For Checkpoint Evaluation
You can proceed to download the code onto your computer and open up with your favorite text editor. It is advisable to have the appropriate linter installed and configured on your IDE of choice.

(TODO: Add in guides to download and configure linters on Sublime and computer)

### For Project Submissions
Ensure that you have cloned the repository to your local environment. If you are reviewing a pull request, you can get the branch you would like to review by running `git checkout --track origin/<branch-name>`. You can then open up the code in your IDE of choice and start reviewing. Ensure you have a linter installed as mentioned earlier.

### Remember your SPECS
The SPECS acronym summarise the philosophy we should embrace when doing code reviews.
- Simplify Code
- Practice Kindness
- Explain Why & with Examples
